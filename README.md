# C-Projects
The projects are a mixture of utility functions that can be copy pasted into other projects and simple challenges, to improve my programming skills

Due to the small nature of the projects, documentation for each file can be found as comments above the code. The exception to this is
Barcode Reader, where a seperate README can be found inside the project folder.
